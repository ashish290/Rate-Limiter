Prompt 1 – Understanding the Task

"Summarize the requirements of the attached PDF task for implementing a rate-limiting middleware in Node.js using TypeScript. Provide a step-by-step plan for implementation."

LLM Response:
The assistant analyzed the task and produced a structured breakdown:

Middleware to allow only 5 requests per minute per user.

Identify users by UUID v4.

Store counters in an in-memory Map.

Reset counters every minute.

Return standard headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset).

On exceeding the limit, return a 429 error with JSON response.

Make limit and window configurable using environment variables.

Prompt 2 – Middleware Implementation

"Write a TypeScript implementation of a reusable Express middleware for rate limiting, following the requirements: UUID v4 for user ID, in-memory Map for counters, configurable limit and window, and proper headers."

LLM Response:
The assistant generated a production-ready rateLimiter.ts file with request tracking logic, UUID assignment, counter resets, and error handling.

Prompt 3 – Project Setup

"Provide a complete Node.js + TypeScript Express project structure for this task, including index.ts, middleware, dotenv configuration, and sample route to test the middleware."

LLM Response:
The assistant outlined the project folder structure, index.ts entry file, .env configuration, and demonstrated usage of the middleware across all routes.

Prompt 4 – Clarification on Storage

"Do we need to use MongoDB or any external database for this task?"

LLM Response:
The assistant clarified that the requirement explicitly states using only an in-memory Map, not MongoDB or any other database.

Prompt 5 – Documentation

"Create a professional PROMPTS.md file that records the prompts used during this project in a structured way for submission."

LLM Response:
The assistant generated this PROMPTS.md file.
